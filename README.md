# Database
Microsoft's Common Objects in Context dataset (COCO) is the most popular object detection dataset at the moment. It is widely used to benchmark the performance of computer vision methods.

The COCO Dataset: The MS COCO dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset published by Microsoft.

COCO stands for Common Objects in Context, as the image dataset was created with the goal of advancing image recognition.

The COCO dataset contains challenging, high-quality visual datasets for computer vision, mostly state-of-the-art neural networks.
# List of the COCO Object Classes
The COCO dataset classes for object detection and tracking include the following pre-trained 80 objects:
