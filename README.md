# ObjectDetection
we will Create applications that upload images or videos to detect the object and the category of all objects present in this image.
Training a performing deep learning model for object detection
Evaluate your model.
Test it with random images and video.
# Database
The COCO Dataset
The MS COCO dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset published by Microsoft
COCO stands for Common Objects in Context, as the image dataset was created with the goal of advancing image recognition. The COCO dataset contains challenging, high-quality visual datasets for computer vision, mostly state-of-the-art neural networks.
#List of the COCO Object Classes
The COCO dataset classes for object detection and tracking include the following pre-trained 80 objects:
